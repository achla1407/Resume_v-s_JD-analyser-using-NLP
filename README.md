### ðŸ¤” The Problem

Manually tailoring a resume for every single job application is tedious and time-consuming. It's often difficult to know which keywords and skills to emphasize to pass through both automated Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) and human recruiters. This tool was built to solve that problem by providing instant, data-driven feedback.

## âš™ How It Works

The application leverages a core Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline to analyze the documents:

1.  *Text Extraction*: For PDF resumes, the tool uses the pdfplumber library to accurately extract all text content.
2.  *Text Cleaning & Preprocessing*: Both the resume and job description texts are standardized. This involves converting text to lowercase and removing common "stopwords" (e.g., "the," "is," "a") which don't add significant meaning.
3.  *TF-IDF Vectorization: The cleaned texts are transformed into numerical representations using the **Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)* algorithm from scikit-learn. TF-IDF assigns a weight to each word, signifying its importance in the context of the document. Keywords that appear frequently in the job description but not in a large corpus of general documents will receive a higher score.
4.  *Cosine Similarity: Once the resume and job description are converted into numerical vectors, **Cosine Similarity* is used to measure the cosine of the angle between them. This metric effectively determines how similar the two documents are. A score closer to 1 (or 100%) indicates a higher degree of similarity in their keyword content.
